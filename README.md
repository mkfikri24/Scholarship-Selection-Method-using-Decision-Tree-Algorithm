# Scholarship-Selection-Method-using-Decision-Tree-Algorithm

## Overview:
Universities conduct selection of scholarship recipients by processing existing data. Many factors that affect the acceptance of scholarship, such as achievement, economic and other factors.
  1. Problem: Manual selection - Manual selection results in the selection of recipient candidates who are not on target.
  2. Method: CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining), Decision Tree Algorithm.
  3. Solution: Machine Learning - With the Decision Tree Algorithm, it is expected to help select candidates with the right target.

## Result:
Based on the results of the research that has been presented in the previous chapter, it can be concluded that the Decision Tree model that has been made and conclusion can be drawn that the Decision Tree model that has been created and applied to the dataset get results,
  1. Accuracy = 0.991,
  2. Recall = 0.992,
  3. Precision = 0.992,
  4. and F1 Score = 0.992.
Based on these results, it proves that using the Decision Tree algorithm gets a high performance evaluation value so that it can be used to select students who are entitled to a scholarship.
